Madlib is an open source set of analytic routines that are optimized to run in the Pivotal Greenplum Database.  The routines encompass a large set of Machine Learning tools that Data Scientists and Analysts use frequently.  In addition, they often use programs in Python and R that can be downloaded and used in conjunction with pl/r to broaden the toolset.

In this small set of exercises, first compute some statistics using built-in functions, then use the madlib's summary function.  Then do some linear regressions to try to predict if length of flight or departure delay are good predictors of arrival delay.  This is not a statistics primer.  If you run the regressions, remember your Statistics 101 a bit, and read the madlib documentation, you'll better understand the examples.
