In this exercise we run our first query.

Our first query contains (all standard PostgreSQL SQL):
* a JOIN of the "otp_r" fact table to the "d_airlines" dimension table
* some aggregation
* some grouping and ordering (which involve sorting)
* some casting to different data types
* filtering by WHERE clause
* and the use of split_part(), a built-in string manipulation function

Other queries we want to run.

Which months of the year have the longest/shortest average delays?
Which airlines have the best/worst on time records?
Which airports have the best/worst on time departures?
Which airport/airline combinations have the best/worst on time departures?

Check airline cancellations
