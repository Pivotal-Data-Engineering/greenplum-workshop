Skew occurs when the segments are not each doing roughly the same amount of work.  Static skew occurs when the data is not distributed evenly between the segments.  This can be a very serious performance impediment.  In our data, we see there is a column called diverted, for flights that are rerouted to a different airport than their scheduled destination.   This is a rare event.  If we create a table where we use the diverted column as the distribution key, we get almost all of the data in one of the two segments in our 2 segment Pivotal Greenplum Database.  As a result, processing will take rougly twice as long as one of the two segments is doing almost no work.  

In addition to static skew, there is dynamic skew.  This can happen when data is statically well distributed but a dynamic where clause causes only some of the segments to be utilized and can happen when there is a subselect in the query that chooses only some of the values of the distribution column.  The new Parallel Query Optimizer can detect this dynamic skew.
