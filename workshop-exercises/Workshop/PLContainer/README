First run a simple pythone program that executes the os command "whoami".
Then try to create a user defined function in python as gpuser.  It fails.  Why?
Then create it as gpadmin and grant execute to gpuser.
The function takes as its argument the text of a Linux OS command.
Run the function with the argument "whoami".  Who are you?  Why?

Then create a similar function in PL/Container.  This can be done as gpuser.  Why?
Run the function with the argument "whoami".  Who are you?  Why?
Run the plpython function with the argument "cat /etc/system-release" What is the OS release?
Run the PL/Container function with the argument "cat /etc/system-release".
Are the releases the same?  Why?

When you ran the plpythonu version of the function, whoami said you were gpadmin.
Try it with the containerized version.  Who are you now?

Now for some analytic work in python and its open source mathematical libraries.  
Let's compute 3 measure of centrality in data, the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, and then the harmonic mean.  They have some interesting properties you can explore on your own.

First, let's create some data with numpy_setup.sql
The create the functions in PL/Container wih=th numpy_define_means.sql
Then execute the functions with numpy_calculate_means.
