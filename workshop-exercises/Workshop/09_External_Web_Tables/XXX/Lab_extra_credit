As gpadmin, create an external web table that executes a script to gather iostat output.

Something along the lines of:
iostat -d 1 5 -p sda | grep sda | sed -r "s/ +/,/g"

To get the field types and names, execute 'iostat -d -p sda' and look at the line that starts with "Device:"

Questions:
How many are returned when you run: psql -c 'select * from <your ext table>'
How many rows should you expect?
